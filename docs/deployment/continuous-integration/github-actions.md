# Github Actions

The Dokku project has an official Githb Action available on the [Github Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/dokku). The simplest usage example is as follows:

```yaml
---
name: 'deploy'

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Cloning repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: Push to dokku
        uses: dokku/github-action@v1
        with:
          git_remote_url: 'ssh://dokku@dokku.me:22/appname'
          ssh_private_key: ${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}
```
